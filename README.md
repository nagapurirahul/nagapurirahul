## Attribute Information :
  ### Input variables (based on physicochemical tests) -
    
    1. fixed acidity — primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic.
    2. volatile acidity — the gaseous acids present in wine.
    3. citric acid — the weak organic acid found in citrus fruits naturally.
    4. residual sugar — amount of sugar left after fermentation.
    5. chlorides — amount of salt present in wine.
    6. free sulfur dioxide — used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
    7. total sulfur dioxide — the portion of SO2 that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine.
    8. density — the mass per unit volume of wine.
    9. pH — used for checking acidity.
    10. alcohol — percent of alcohol present in wine.
    11. sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
    
  ### Output variable (based on sensory data) -
    
    12. quality
